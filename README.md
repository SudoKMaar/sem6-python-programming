# Python Programming

This repository contains all the Python programs I have created during my 6th semester Python Programming Lab. Each program is an implementation of various Python concepts, ranging from basic syntax to advanced features.

## Introduction
The Python Programming is part of the BCA â€“ 3rd Year curriculum, where students learn and apply Python programming skills. This repository serves as a digital record of all the programs I have written, showcasing my progress and understanding of Python.

## Programs
All programs are located in the same directory, and they follow a naming convention like `01a.py`, `01b.py`, and so on. Here's a brief overview of the programs included:

- **01a.py, 01b.py, 01c.py, 01d.py**: Control Structures
  - Largest among three numbers
  - Leap year checker
  - Grade calculator based on marks
  - Valid date checker and next date printer
- **02a.py, 02b.py, 02c.py, 02d.py, 02e.py**: Loops and Number Theory
  - Prime number checker
  - LCM and GCD calculator
  - Sum of digits
  - Binary to decimal converter
  - Fibonacci series generator
- **03a.py, 03b.py**: Data Structures
  - List operations and manipulations
  - Fruit seller's bill calculator with discount logic
- **04a.py, 04b.py**: Sets, Tuples, and Dictionaries
  - Character frequency counter using dictionaries
  - Furniture store bill calculator with GST and discount
- **05a.py, 05b.py**: Functions and Global Variables
  - Keyword and default arguments demonstration
  - Variable length arguments and global variable usage
- **06a.py, 06b.py**: Object-Oriented Programming
  - Account and Employee class implementations with class methods and static methods
- **07a.py, 07b.py**: Inheritance
  - Polygon and Triangle classes with area calculation
  - Person and Student classes with branch changing method
- **08a.py, 08b.py**: Polymorphism and Operator Overloading
  - Retail outlet bill calculation with different payment modes
  - Length class with overloaded "+" operator
- **09a.py, 09b.py, 09c.py**: File Handling
  - Word frequency dictionary from file
  - Student information retriever from file
  - Company name extractor from email IDs
- **10a.py, 10b.py**: Exception Handling
  - Division function with exception handling
  - Read-only file handling demonstration

## Installation
To run these programs, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: Python.org.

## Usage
To execute a program, navigate to the repository's directory and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python <program_name>.py
```

Replace `<program_name>` with the actual name of the program file you wish to run.
